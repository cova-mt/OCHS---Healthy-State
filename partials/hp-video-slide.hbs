    <p class="body-text text-el">Dianne McAnelly of Prairieville, Louisiana, started smoking in 1962 and didn&rsquo;t stop for 60 years. On average, she smoked about two packs of cigarettes a day and had no intentions of ever quitting. As her health started to deteriorate, what finally led her to quit? <a href="/">Ochsner Health&rsquo;s Smoking Cessation program.</a></p>
    <blockquote class="text-el">
        <p><q>It&rsquo;s been just a miraculous thing,</q> McAnelly said. <q>It&rsquo;s all thanks to Ochsner and this program.</q></p>
